A Python package and web app to turn data into sound by mapping their principal components to a harmonic overtone spectrum.

This repository contains the code for the Python package, which you can install with

```shell
pip install harmonicsonification
```

For examples of how to use the Python library see the documentation: https://robert-lieck.github.io/harmonicsonification/

The web app is accessible at https://harmonify-ten.vercel.app with code at https://github.com/tonydalziel/harmonify.

For more details about the methods, see our paper: **Harmonic Sonification of High-Dimensional Continuous Data**.
